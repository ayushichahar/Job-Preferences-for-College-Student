 ## Problem Domain
 In today's competitive job market, college students often face challenges in aligning their
 skills and preferences with suitable career paths and job opportunities. Despite the
 availability of various career resources, students may struggle to identify the best career
 options that match their unique profiles. This misalignment can lead to dissatisfaction,
 underemployment, or prolonged job searches after graduation. To address this issue, we propose the development of a Student Career Path
 Recommendation System. This system aims to leverage machine learning to provide
 personalized career and job recommendations to college students based on their skills,
 job preferences, domain preferences, and basic information. By offering tailored
 guidance, the system can enhance students' career planning and increase their chances of
 securing fulfilling and relevant employment.
